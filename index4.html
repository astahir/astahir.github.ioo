    <h2 style="color:#cc0000;background-color:cccccc"> Three reasons why you should help raise awareness</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> When awareness is created, it helps to create more treatment options for those who have the condition, and also helps create more ways to prevent different forms of dementia.</li>
        <li>When the signs are recognized early, detection can occur, and treatment can be provided early on.</li>
        <li>Awareness also helps remind people of the importance of caregivers and health providers, who play a large role in helping those with Alzheimer's carry on through life.</li>
    </ol>

    Ronald Reagan on why he went public with Alzheimer's:
    <blockquote>
        "Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way.... We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a result many more people underwent testing."
