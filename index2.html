<p> The clock is ticking... <br> We are a non-profit organization group that simply wants to raise awareness of this disease. With over 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease, and those numbers expected to triple by 2050, it's more important than ever to get informed on the prevention and treatment of dementia, and promote greater understanding of the disease and its symptoms so that it can be detected and treated early.
