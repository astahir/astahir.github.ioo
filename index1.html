        What is Alzheimer's Disease? <br> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain from which there is no recovery. The disease slowly attacks nerve cells in all parts of the cortex of the brain and some surrounding structures, thereby impairing a person's abilities to govern emotions, recognize errors and patterns, coordinate movement, and remember. Ultimately, a person with AD loses all memory and mental functioning.
        Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in people age 65 years and older. Dementia is significant loss of cognitive functions such as memory, judgment, attention, and abstract thinking. Typically, close relatives of individuals who have Alzheimer's have a higher percentage of getting the disease.

            <strong> Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease: </strong>
            The most common symptom of Alzheimer's is difficulty in remembering newly learned information. As the disease progresses, the patient will have trouble finding the right words to express himself or herself.They will soon have trouble making judgments and decisions. Alzheimer's also leads to a weaker immune system giving the patient an increased chance of catching the disease.
