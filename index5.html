        <dt>Q:What is the difference between Alzheimer's and dementia?</dt>
        <dd>A:Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia. Generally, dementia is a decline in thinking, reasoning, and/or remembering.</dd>
        <dt>Q:What are the genetic risk factors?</dt>
        <dd>A:Familial or early-onset Alzheimer's disease is inherited and develops in people before age 60. If even one of three gene mutations that causes the disease is inherited from a parent, the child will almost certainly develop Alzheimer's. However, fewer than five percent of patients have early-onset Alzheimer's disease.</dd>
        <dt>Q:How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed?</dt>
        <dd>A:Only an autopsy can positively confirm the disease.However, physicians can correctly diagnose Alzheimer's about 90 percent of the time based on mental and behavioral symptoms.</dd>

        <p>
            Alzheimer's is a fatal and progressive brain disease. It kills nerve cells in the brain, affecting a person's ability to remember, think and plan. People with Alzheimer's lose their ability to communicate, recognize family and friends, and care for themselves. Currently, there is no way to prevent, cure or even slow Alzheimer's. Together, we can stand up and raise awareness for this disease. Every day, people across the world are changing the course of Alzheimer's disease by raising awareness. You can too!

            <li>The cost for treating this disease has grown up to $236 billion</li>
